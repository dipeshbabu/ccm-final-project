# Quantifying Risk Aversion and Risk-Seeking Behavior Through Utility-Based Policy Learning in Blackjack

This repository contains the implementation and analysis for the research project titled _"Quantifying Risk Aversion and Risk-Seeking Behavior Through Utility-Based Policy Learning in Blackjack"_. The project explores decision-making under risk and uncertainty through utility-based policies in a simulated Blackjack environment.

## Overview

In this research, we modeled Blackjack as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and applied various utility functions to investigate how different risk preferences influence decision-making. We used dynamic programming techniques to derive optimal policies and analyzed the outcomes using simulations and data analysis.

## Key Features

1. **Blackjack as an MDP**: Models the game as a Markov Decision Process with defined states, actions, and rewards.
2. **Utility-Based Policies**: Implements utility functions to explore risk-averse, risk-neutral, and risk-seeking behaviors.
3. **Simulations**: Evaluates decision-making strategies over multiple rounds using precomputed optimal actions.
4. **Data Analysis**: Provides insights into the impact of different utility functions on gameplay outcomes.
